# Hearthstone-Pack-Opening-Tracker [Obsolete]
A software able to keep track of pack openings and fetch statistics in Hearthstone.

## Note!!!
This project is OBSOLETE due to ulterior changes made to how logs are being processed in Hearthstone. It can no longer track pack openings, but I have provided a test file (found in Debug/Save after the project is compiled), which still allows for interactions with certain features of the app, in case that's needed.
